# bare-duino
Bare metal project for Arduino UNO board

This project aims to understand how to create programs for the Arduino UNO board outside of the Arduino toolbox.
It will primarily use the AVR GCC toolchain for compilation and the avrdude tool to upload the binaries on the board.

## Setup

* Download AVR gcc toolchain :
* Install and configure the toolchain

## Compilation and installation

* Create the binary
* Upload the binary

## About

We will try to implement basic features like a serial console or drivers for specific devices like a RF transmitter/receiver or bluetooth components.
